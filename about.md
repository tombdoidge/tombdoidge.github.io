A blacksmith and software engineer based in the UK. I'm currently enjoying blacksmithing, but have studied computer science at Imperial College London and have developed a broad skillset in solving real life problems with software.

##Highlights


* Development of a bot to solve  the word game Scrabble Cubes, a game users play for money (not released public).

* Creation of a hack within [World Of Warcraft](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft) allowing the character to walk through walls and access otherwise restricted areas (not released public).

* Cracking various commercial applications (not released public).

* [Half-life 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-Life_2) Mod development.

* Helped a startup develop their award winning iOS app [Momento](https://momentoapp.com/).

* IQ has been assessed at 130+ through state tests (Not that I put much stake in it :).
